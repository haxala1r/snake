# Snake

You already know what this game is. It's snake. 

It's a couple hundred lines of code I wrote to test my new development
environment. Nothing fancy, just a snaky boi eating some apples.

Have fun.

`g++ snake.cpp -lSDL2 -o snake ; ./snake`

You need libsdl2-dev installed of course (via apt or otherwise)
